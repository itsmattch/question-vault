## Question Vault

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

**Question Vault** is a curated collection of over 200 handpicked interview
questions designed to cover a vast array of topics and challenge candidates of
all skill levels.

Question Vault is a free resource committed to helping interviewers design more
effective, targeted interviews and job seekers to better prepare for their
upcoming interviews.

The questions follow an escalating format, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics. This structure allows
you to gauge the depth and breadth of a candidate's understanding, or to
progressively build your own knowledge in a structured, manageable way.

### Questions

Each "big question" in the Question Vault is associated with a series of
preceding questions. These preceding questions incrementally build up from basic
to more complex concepts related to the "big question".

### Question Template

#### ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts

List the key terms or concepts that are crucial to understanding and answering
the question. This will often include technical terminology and principles
related to the question.

understanding of the topic.

#### ðŸŒ¿ Acceptable Answer

This is a more basic, yet still correct, answer that shows the candidate
understands the essential aspects of the topic.

#### ðŸ’Ž Extra Points

This section lists additional topics or information that a candidate might
mention or explain to show an exceptional understanding or a wide breadth of
knowledge about the topic.

#### ðŸ¤“ Explanation

A non-technical, simplified explanation of the topic or concept. This
explanation should make the concept understandable to someone without a
background in the field.

#### ðŸ’¡ Evaluation Tips

Specific pointers and criteria to help the interviewer assess the candidate's
answer. This might include common mistakes to watch out for, or signs of an
especially good understanding.

it can reveal about the candidate. This could include how the question relates
to typical tasks in the role or what specific skills or knowledge it can assess.

A list of reliable resources (e.g., articles, tutorials, official documentation)
for the candidate or interviewer to learn more about the topic.

### Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Question Vault! It's people like you
that make this project such a great resource. If you have a great question (or
series of questions) that you believe should be included, or any suggestions for
improving existing questions.

We are looking for contributions of new questions, improvements to existing
questions, and even entirely new topics. The questions should follow the
escalating format of the Question Vault, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics.
