**Question Vault** is a curated collection of handpicked web development
interview questions designed to cover a vast array of topics and challenge
candidates of all skill levels.

Going beyond the conventional knowledge-oriented approach, Question Vault adopts
a problem-oriented perspective. Each series of questions is more than a test of
knowledge; it's a pathway leading towards the understanding of specific
challenges, exploring solutions to complex issues, or gaining in-depth insight
into various functionalities.

The focus here is on addressing real-world complications and nuances, an
approach that not only broadens your practical comprehension but also
strengthens your problem-solving prowess. This makes Question Vault a diverse
toolkit for interviewers and an all-inclusive study resource for aspiring
candidates.

### Important: Developers Are Not Walking Encyclopedias

Interviews are not memory contests. While it's important for a candidate to
demonstrate a firm understanding of the concepts, it's also unrealistic to
expect them to recall all specific details or syntax perfectly.

In everyday work, developers often refer to documentation, stackoverflow, or
other resources. **A good developer is not someone who knows everything by
heart, but rather one who knows how to find and apply information efficiently**.

### Questions

The questions follow an escalating format, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics. This structure allows
you to gauge the depth and breadth of a candidate's understanding, or to
progressively build your own knowledge in a structured, manageable way.

### How to Conduct an Interview

Conducting an effective interview is a skill that requires careful planning and
thoughtful execution. When done correctly, it can provide deep insights into a
candidate's knowledge, skills, and suitability for a role. Here are some
strategies to consider:

#### Choose relevant questions

In an interview, it's critical to ask questions that are relevant to the role
you're hiring for. While it can be interesting to explore a candidate's
knowledge in various areas, sticking to job-related topics is usually more
productive and respectful of the candidate's time.

#### Start with simple questions

Initiating the interview with straightforward questions can help put the
candidate at ease and set a positive tone for the rest of the interview. It also
helps avoid
[learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness).

#### Incrementally increase complexity

Move towards more complex and detailed topics incrementally. This approach not
only maps the breadth and depth of a candidate's knowledge but also gives their
brain a chance to "warm up".

#### End on a positive note

End the interview on a positive note with a question the candidate can answer
confidently. [The recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias)
suggests that the last moments of an experience can significantly influence how
a person remembers the overall event. By ending on a strong note, you can help
ensure the candidate leaves with a positive impression of the interview process.

### Question Template

**🎯 Key Concepts**: List the key terms or concepts that are crucial to
understanding and answering the question. This will often include technical
terminology and principles related to the question.

**👑 Flawless Answer**: This is the comprehensive, detailed answer that displays
in-depth knowledge and understanding of the topic.

**🌿 Acceptable Answer**: This is a more basic, yet still correct, answer that
shows the candidate understands the essential aspects of the topic.

**💎 Extra Points**: This section lists additional topics or information that a
candidate might mention or explain to show an exceptional understanding or a
wide breadth of knowledge about the topic.

**🤓 Explanation**: A non-technical, simplified explanation of the topic or
concept. This explanation should make the concept understandable to someone
without a background in the field.

**💡 Evaluation Tips**: Specific pointers and criteria to help the interviewer
assess the candidate's answer. This might include common mistakes to watch out
for, or signs of an especially good understanding.
