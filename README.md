## Question Vault

Welcome to **Question Vault**, a comprehensive, curated collection of over 200
handpicked interview questions designed to cover a vast array of topics and
challenge candidates of all skill levels.

Question Vault is a free resource committed to helping interviewers design more
effective, targeted interviews and job seekers to better prepare for their
upcoming interviews.

The questions follow an escalating format, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics. This structure allows
you to gauge the depth and breadth of a candidate's understanding, or to
progressively build your own knowledge in a structured, manageable way.

### Questions

Each "big question" in the Question Vault is associated with a series of
preceding questions. These preceding questions incrementally build up from basic
to more complex concepts related to the "big question".

### Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Question Vault! It's people like you
that make this project such a great resource. If you have a great question (or
series of questions) that you believe should be included, or any suggestions for
improving existing questions.

We are looking for contributions of new questions, improvements to existing
questions, and even entirely new topics. The questions should follow the
escalating format of the Question Vault, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics.
