## Question Vault

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

**Question Vault** is a curated collection of handpicked web development
interview questions designed to cover a vast array of topics and challenge
candidates of all skill levels.

### Questions

The questions follow an escalating format, starting from basic concepts and
gradually moving towards more complex and specific topics. This structure allows
you to gauge the depth and breadth of a candidate's understanding, or to
progressively build your own knowledge in a structured, manageable way.

### How to Conduct an Interview

Conducting an effective interview is a skill that requires careful planning and
thoughtful execution. When done correctly, it can provide deep insights into a
candidate's knowledge, skills, and suitability for a role. Here are some
strategies to consider:

#### Choose relevant questions

In an interview, it's critical to ask questions that are relevant to the role
you're hiring for. While it can be interesting to explore a candidate's
knowledge in various areas, sticking to job-related topics is usually more
productive and respectful of the candidate's time.

#### Start with simple questions

Initiating the interview with straightforward questions can help put the
candidate at ease and set a positive tone for the rest of the interview. It also
helps avoid
[learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness).

#### Incrementally increase complexity

Move towards more complex and detailed topics incrementally. This approach not
only maps the breadth and depth of a candidate's knowledge but also gives their
brain a chance to "warm up".

#### End on a positive note

End the interview on a positive note with a question the candidate can answer
confidently. [The recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias)
suggests that the last moments of an experience can significantly influence how
a person remembers the overall event. By ending on a strong note, you can help
ensure the candidate leaves with a positive impression of the interview process.
