## How are floating point numbers represented in computer memory?

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts

- Floating point number
- IEEE 754 standard

### ðŸ‘‘ Flawless Answer

Floating point numbers are typically represented in computer memory following
the IEEE 754 standard. This format comprises three parts: the sign, the
exponent, and the significand (also known as the mantissa). The sign is a single
bit that indicates whether the number is positive or negative. The exponent
determines the position of the floating point in the number, and the significand
is the actual fractional part of the number.

The number represented in memory is given by sign * significand * 2^exponent.
The exact number of bits allocated to the exponent and significand depends on
whether it's a single-precision or double-precision floating point number.
Single-precision numbers use 8 bits for the exponent and 23 for the significand,
while double-precision numbers use 11 bits for the exponent and 52 for the
significand.

### ðŸŒ¿ Acceptable Answer

Floating point numbers are represented in memory using three parts: the sign,
exponent, and significand. The sign indicates whether the number is positive or
negative, the exponent specifies the position of the decimal point, and the
significand represents the actual number.

### ðŸ’Ž Extra Points

- Knowledge of single-precision and double-precision differences.

### ðŸ¤“ Explanation

When a computer stores a floating point number (like 12.34), it breaks it down
into three parts: whether it's positive or negative, where the decimal point is,
and what the number is. These three pieces are put together in a specific way (
following a standard called IEEE 754) to store the number in memory.

### ðŸ’¡ Evaluation Tips

- Candidates should at least be aware of the basic idea of sign, exponent, and
  significand when it comes to floating point representation.
- Flawless answers will demonstrate understanding of the IEEE 754 standard and
  may go into detail about the number of bits allocated for the exponent and
  significand.

### âœ¨ Insights

- Understanding how floating point numbers are represented can help developers
  debug precision issues and is fundamental for performance optimization in
  certain fields.
- Deep understanding of floating point representation is crucial in fields
  requiring high precision calculations or optimization at a low level.
