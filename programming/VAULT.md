## Floating-point error mitigation

In any system where precise mathematical calculations are critical, handling
floating-point numbers can pose significant challenges due to inherent
imprecision issues. This is particularly crucial in financial systems where
currency calculations demand high precision, and in scientific computations or
engineering applications that might involve very large or very small numbers.

1. [What is a floating point number?](/programming/repository/float.md)
2. How are floating point numbers represented in computer memory?
3. What does it mean to say that floating point numbers have "rounding errors"?
4. Why is it not recommended to directly compare two floating point numbers for
   equality?
5. Can you explain a technique to compare floating point numbers with a degree
   of tolerance or "closeness"?
6. Can you discuss any potential performance implications or trade-offs when
   using mitigation techniques for floating point errors?
