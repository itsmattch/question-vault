## General Programming

This collection covers a wide array of topics that form the foundation of
programming across various languages and paradigms. The aim of it is to provide
an in-depth understanding of key techniques and methodologies that underpin
programming, irrespective of specific language syntax or semantics.

### Floating-point error mitigation

Due to the imprecise nature of floating-point arithmetic, understanding how to
mitigate errors that can arise from this imprecision is essential.

In any system where precise mathematical calculations are critical, handling
floating-point numbers can pose significant challenges due to inherent
imprecision issues.

This is particularly crucial in financial systems where currency calculations
demand high precision, and in scientific computations or engineering
applications that might involve very large or very small numbers.

### Common Numeral Systems

Understanding the different numeral systems, such as binary, decimal, and
hexadecimal, is a foundational skill in programming.

These numeral systems are used extensively in various aspects of programming,
from low-level system design to high-level application development.

### Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a powerful design pattern that fundamentally changes how
applications are designed and can offer significant benefits in terms of
scalability, traceability, and system design.

Having a good understanding of event sourcing can open up new possibilities in
how to design and build applications.
